  abstract  = {Motivation: High-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) is among the most widely used technologies in metabolomics. Metabolites participate in almost all cellular processes, but most metabolites still remain uncharacterized. Determination of the sum formula is a crucial step in the identification of an unknown metabolite, as it reduces its possible structures to a hopefully manageable set. Results: We present a method for determining the sum formula of a metabolite solely from its mass and the natural distribution of its isotopes. Our input is a measured isotope pattern from a high resolution mass spectrometer, and we want to find those molecules that best match this pattern. Our method is computationally efficient, and results on experimental data are very promising: For orthogonal time-of-flight mass spectrometry, we correctly identify sum formulas for more than 90\% of the molecules, ranging in mass up to 1000 Da.

  abstract  = {Untargeted metabolomics commonly uses liquid chromatography mass spectrometry to measure abundances of metabolites; subsequent tandem mass spectrometry is used to derive information about individual compounds. One of the bottlenecks in this experimental setup is the interpretation of fragmentation spectra to accurately and efficiently identify compounds. Fragmentation trees have become a powerful tool for the interpretation of tandem mass spectrometry data of small molecules. These trees are determined from the data using combinatorial optimization, and aim at explaining the experimental data via fragmentation cascades. Fragmentation tree computation does not require spectral or structural databases. To obtain biochemically meaningful trees, one needs an elaborate optimization function (scoring).
We present a new scoring for computing fragmentation trees, transforming the combinatorial optimization into a Maximum A Posteriori estimator. We demonstrate the superiority of the new scoring for two tasks: Both for the de novo identification of molecular formulas of unknown compounds, and for searching a database for structurally similar compounds, our method SIRIUS 3, performs significantly better than the previous version of our method, as well as other methods for this task.
SIRIUS 3 can be a part of an untargeted metabolomics workflow, allowing researchers to investigate unknowns using automated computational methods.},

CANOPUS uses a deep neural network to predict 2,497â€‰compound classes from fragmentation spectra, including all biologically relevant classes. CANOPUS explicitly targets compounds for which neither spectral nor structural reference data are available and predicts classes lacking tandem mass spectrometry training data. In evaluation using reference data, CANOPUS reached very high prediction performance (average accuracy of 99.7% in cross-validation) and outperformed four baseline methods. We demonstrate the broad utility of CANOPUS by investigating the effect of microbial colonization in the mouse digestive system, through analysis of the chemodiversity of different Euphorbia plants and regarding the discovery of a marine natural product, revealing biological insights at the compound class level.},

SIRIUS has become a powerful tool for the interpretation of tandem mass spectra, and shows outstanding performance for identifying the molecular formula of a query compound, being the first step of structure identification. Nevertheless, the identification of both molecular formulas for large compounds above 500 Daltons and novel molecular formulas remains highly challenging.

ZODIAC reranks SIRIUS{\textquoteright} molecular formula candidates, combining fragmentation tree computation with Bayesian statistics using Gibbs sampling. Through careful algorithm engineering, ZODIAC{\textquoteright}s Gibbs sampling is very swift in practice. ZODIAC decreases incorrect annotations 16.2-fold on a challenging plant extract dataset with most compounds above 700 Dalton; we then show improvements on four additional, diverse datasets. Our analysis led to the discovery of compounds with novel molecular formulas such as C24H47BrNO8P which, as of today, is not present in any publicly available molecular structure databases.},

In contrast to biology, geology, and many other scientific disciplines, the world of chemistry still lacks a standardized chemical ontology or taxonomy. Several attempts at chemical classification have been made; but they have mostly been limited to either manual, or semi-automated proof-of-principle applications. This is regrettable as comprehensive chemical classification and description tools could not only improve our understanding of chemistry but also improve the linkage between chemistry and many other fields. For instance, the chemical classification of a compound could help predict its metabolic fate in humans, its druggability or potential hazards associated with it, among others. However, the sheer number (tens of millions of compounds) and complexity of chemical structures is such that any manual classification effort would prove to be near impossible.},

We use the fragmentation tree to predict the molecular structure fingerprint of the unknown compound using machine learning. This fingerprint is then used to search a molecular structure database such as PubChem.

As biological interpretation relies on accurate structure annotations, the ability to assign confidence to such annotations is a key outstanding problem. We introduce the COSMIC workflow that combines structure database generation, in silico annotation, and a confidence score consisting of kernel density p-value estimation and a Support Vector Machine with enforced directionality of features. In evaluation, COSMIC annotates a substantial number of hits at small false discovery rates, and outperforms spectral library search for this purpose. To demonstrate that COSMIC can annotate structures never reported before, we annotated twelve novel bile acid conjugates; nine structures were confirmed by manual evaluation and two structures using synthetic standards. Second, we annotated and manually evaluated 315 molecular structures in human samples currently absent from the Human Metabolome Database. Third, we applied COSMIC to 17,400 experimental runs and annotated 1,715 structures with high confidence that were absent from spectral libraries.},

Consequently, a need exists for an automated structure-type classification system to handle the massive amounts of data appearing for NP structures. An ideal semantic ontology for the classification of NPs should go beyond the simple presence/absence of chemical substructures, but also include the taxonomy of the producing organism, the nature of the biosynthetic pathway, and/or their biological properties. Thus, a holistic and automatic NP classification framework could have considerable value to comprehensively navigate the relatedness of NPs, and especially so when analyzing large numbers of NPs. Here, we introduce NPClassifier, a deep-learning tool for the automated structural classification of NPs from their counted Morgan fingerprints. NPClassifier is expected to accelerate and enhance NP discovery by linking NP structures to their underlying properties. },

In evaluation, MSNovelist correctly reproduced 61\% of database annotations for a GNPS reference dataset. In a bryophyte MS2 dataset, our de novo structure prediction substantially outscored the best database candidate for seven features, and a potential novel natural product with a flavonoid core was identified. MSNovelist allows predicting structures solely from MS2 data, and is therefore ideally suited to complement library-based annotation in the case of poorly represented analyte classes and novel compounds.Competing Interest StatementSB and KD are cofounders of Bright Giant GmbH.},
